# Welcome to Breakout-X
Welcome to my special repository.
My goal in using GitHub is to create projects that allow other people to be creative, easier, faster, and better.

Please note that a lot of my applications are currently unavalible. Open-Source ones will be placed back up while copyrighted ones will stay private.

--------
My programming language is called `Rexercat-Script`, which uses a combination JavaScript, machine code, and commands to create `MasterCode Binary Applications.`
> [Learn more](https://GitHub.com/Breakout-X/Rexercat-Script/).

You can use the language in your work by creating a file called `Complier.mcfr` or `.mcfx` and importing the code from the latest complier version. You will need to download the JavaScript transpiler once it's re-realeased since it's no longer available on ELedlow's GitHub account.
> For more information, please visit [**Web-Breakout**](https://GitHub.com/Web-Breakout/Web-Breakout.github.io).

--------
If you want to learn how to make sprite animation using JavaScript and Rexercat-Script, I'll soon release a repository about on how to do it in JavaScript and HTML5. It will be open-source (aside from any copyrighted sprites and music) and will a full package.
