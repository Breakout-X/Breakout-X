# Welcome to Breakout-X
My name is Elijah Ledlow. I am an indie developer, artist, and story writer.

My goal in using GitHub is to create projects that allow other people to be creative easier, faster, and better.

Please note that a lot of my applications are currently unavalible due to these two issues:
1. Someone kept reposting my stuff on Chinese websites without my permission. Thankfully, my copyrighted content didn't get reposted as I took it down as soon as I found this out. I had valid reason to worry, but I do apologize for all of the repositories I had to make private or delete permanently.
2. I misread GitHub's guidelines and didn't know that GitHub Public repositories require an open-source license.

I am a part of [**The Web-Breakout Team**](https://github.com/Web-Breakout), and I am the story writer, artist and programmer. I am looking for more members who can do the following:
1. Low-level and Middle-level programmers.
    - I really need these.
2. High-level programmers.
    - I need these.
3. Playtesters.
    - I want these, however I could play test myself if no one volunteers.
4. Pixel Artists.
5. Artists.

Please contact me if you would like to join. However, please note that I currently do not pay members for joining the team. I do apologize in advance if this is why you wanted to join.

My custom programming language is called "`Rexercat Script`", which will be programmed in `C`, `ASM`, `Python`, `Java`, and `NodeJS`. It will be made to create "`Rexercat Applications`" for my future OS. It is currently a work in progress right now.

If you want to learn how to make sprite animation using JavaScript and Rexercat-Script, I'll soon release a repository about on how to do it in JavaScript and HTML5. It will be open-source (aside from any copyrighted sprites and music) and will a full package.
