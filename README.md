# Welcome to Breakout-X
My name is Elijah Ledlow. I am an indie developer, artist, and story writer.

My goal in using GitHub is to create projects that allow other people to be creative easier, faster, and better.

Please note that a lot of my applications are currently unavalible due to these two issues:
1. Someone kept reposting my stuff on other websites without my permission. Thankfully, my copyrighted content didn't get reposted as I took it down as soon as I found this out. I had valid reason to worry, but I do apologize for all of the repositories I had to make private or delete permanently.
2. I misread GitHub's guidelines and didn't know that GitHub Public repositories require an open-source license.

I am a part of [**The Web-Breakout Team**](https://github.com/Web-Breakout).

Please contact me if you would like to join. However, please note that I currently do not pay members for joining the team. I do apologize in advance if this is why you wanted to join.
