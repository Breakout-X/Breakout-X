# Welcome to Breakout-X
Welcome to my special repository.
My goal in using GitHub is to create projects that allow other people to be creative, easier, faster, and better.

--------
My programming language is called the Master Code File Language, which uses machine code and commands to create MasterCode Binary Applications. 
> [Learn more](https://GitHub.com/Breakout-X/MasterCode-Applications).


Currently the version is at v0.5.0 as so far, the only complied thing is JavaScript imports without requiring a ES6 module, meaning that this can be used locally as well.

You can use the language in your work by creating a file called Complier.mcrf or .mcfx and importing the code from the latest complier version. You will need to download the JavaScript transpiler once it's re-realeased since it's no longer available on ELedlow's GitHub account.

If you want to learn how to make my creepy VHS filter, audio distortion, and sprite animation, I'll soon release a repository about on how to do it in JavaScript and HTML5. It will be open-source (aside from the copyrighted sprites) and will a full package.
