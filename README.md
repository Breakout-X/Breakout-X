# Welcome to Breakout-X
Welcome to my special repository.
My goal in using GitHub is to create projects that allow other people to be creative, easier, faster, and better.

Please note that a lot of my applications are currently unavalible. The open source ones will be placed back up while fully copyrighted, restricted, or legally private ones will stay private unless they allow free distributions with credit.

--------
My programming language is called `RexercatScript`, which uses a combination JavaScript, machine code, and commands to create `Rexercat Applications.`
It is currently a work in progress right now.
> [Learn more](https://GitHub.com/Breakout-X/RexercatScript/).

--------
If you want to learn how to make sprite animation using JavaScript and Rexercat-Script, I'll soon release a repository about on how to do it in JavaScript and HTML5. It will be open-source (aside from any copyrighted sprites and music) and will a full package.
